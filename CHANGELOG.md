# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

No unreleased changes.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-11-12

### ✨ Feature: Save Siren Folder Support

- **Folder Organization**: `filename_prefix` now supports folder paths for better file organization
  - Examples: `"portraits/Violet"`, `"fantasy/characters/Violet"`, `"projects/client1/Violet"`
  - Automatically creates subdirectories within ComfyUI's output folder
  - Cross-platform path handling (supports both `/` and `\`)
- **Security**: Robust path sanitization prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Backward Compatible**: Simple prefixes like `"Violet"` work exactly as before
- Updated tooltip to explain new folder syntax

### ✨ Feature: Prompt Node Chaining

- **Modular Prompt Building**: All prompt nodes now support chaining via optional `extra_input`
- **Smart Concatenation**: Changes from override system to additive chaining
  - Old behavior: `extra_input` replaced `extra` field entirely
  - New behavior: `extra_input + ", " + extra` field content
- **Affected Nodes**: Quality Queen, Scene Seductress, Aesthetic Alchemist, Body Bard, Glamour Goddess, Negativity Nullifier, Pose Priestess
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Users can wire prompt outputs together AND add custom text in fields
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing workflows continue to work unchanged

### 🐛 Fix: Save Siren Batch Processing

- **Critical Bug Fix**: Save Siren now properly handles image batches instead of only saving first image
- **Batch Filenames**: Multiple images get unique filenames with batch index (`-000`, `-001`, etc.)
- **Seed Increment**: Each image in batch gets incremented seed for natural variation
- **Complete Metadata**: Every image gets its own full metadata embedding
- **Robust Detection**: Handles both 3D single images and 4D batches correctly

## [2.2.2] - 2025-10-04

### 🔧 Refactor: Hair Tips Color

- **Renamed Field**: `dip_dye_color` → `hair_tips_color` for clearer, more intuitive terminology
- **Updated Suffix**: Changed from `{color} dip-dyed hair` to `{color} hair tips`
- **Added Blonde Variants**: 
  - `blonde hair tips`
  - `light blonde hair tips`
  - `dark blonde hair tips`
- Updated across all configuration files: glamour_goddess.yaml, palette.json, feature_lists.yaml
- Updated documentation in README.md and CHANGELOG.md

### 🐛 Fix: Sweet Descriptor

- Added "sweet" to allowlist to prevent fuzzy matching to "sweets"
- Preserves "sweet" as an aesthetic/vibe descriptor instead of being canonicalized to "sweets" (candy)
- Fixes unwanted candy appearing in images when using "sweet" for atmosphere or mood

## [2.2.1] - 2025-10-01

### ✨ Feature: Prompt Deduplication

- **Phrase-Level Deduplication**: All prompt nodes now automatically deduplicate repeated comma-separated phrases
  - Handles clumsy T5 model outputs that repeat phrases like "a mystical landscape" dozens of times
  - Preserves first occurrence and maintains phrase order
  - Case-sensitive matching (aligns with Stable Diffusion prompt behavior)
  - Example: `"mystical landscape, mystical landscape, mystical landscape"` → `"mystical landscape"`
- **Comma Cleanup**: Fixes malformed comma sequences in generated prompts
  - Cleans up double commas: `"text,, more"` → `"text, more"`
  - Normalizes spacing: `"text, , more"` or `"text,        , more"` → `"text, more"`
- **Smart Word Preservation**: Only deduplicates whole phrases, not individual words
  - `"purple hair, purple fingernails"` → both phrases kept (doesn't dedupe "purple")
  - `"film_grain, film grain"` → both kept (treats underscore/space as different phrases)

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

- New `node_resources/prompt_dedupe.py` module with shared `dedupe_and_clean_prompt()` utility
- Applied to all 8 prompt generation nodes: Oracle Override, Quality Queen, Scene Seductress, Aesthetic Alchemist, Body Bard, Glamour Goddess, Pose Priestess, Negativity Nullifier
- Zero breaking changes: maintains all existing node signatures and return types
- Automatic application: no user configuration needed

### 📊 Impact Example

Real T5 output reduced from 36 phrases to 23 unique phrases by removing 13 duplicate instances and cleaning comma formatting—dramatically improving prompt efficiency for dynamic inputs.

## [2.1.2] - 2025-09-28

### 🐛 Critical Fixes

- **Essence Algorithm Error Handling**: Fixed "kSampler list index out of range" error that occurred when using optimize_prompt with characters that had empty negative prompts
  - Enhanced `_alias_or_canonical` function with proper tuple unpacking error handling for rapidfuzz results
  - Added placeholder value filtering to consolidator (removes "random", "none", "unspecified", etc.)
  - Fixed negative conditioning handling to always return valid conditioning objects instead of None
  - Characters with empty negative prompts (like default Character Curator saves) now work properly with prompt optimization

## [2.1.1] - 2025-09-27

### 🐛 Critical Fix

- **Character Sync Distribution**: Moved `character_sync.py` from ignored `lib/` folder to `node_resources/` folder
  - Fixes "works on my machine" issue where character sync functionality was only available locally
  - All users now receive character sync endpoints and functionality
  - Updated import paths accordingly

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-26

### 🔮 Oracle's Override (Refined)

- Simplified to a single output: `override`.
- New `chain` input lets you prepend text to the manual override; both `chain` and `override` are joined with ", " and support wildcards using `{a|b|c}` syntax (resolved repeatedly until stable).
- Output is `null` unless `override_prompts` is true. When true, the combined string is emitted and used as the full positive prompt.
- VT styling applied to the node for consistent visuals.

### 🧬 Encoding Enchantress Integration

- Accepts a single optional `override` input. If the value is not null (empty string allowed), it is used as the entire positive prompt, skipping mode grouping. If null, normal prompt assembly proceeds.
- Token report includes the override section when used.

### � Prompt Optimization (Essence Algorithm)

- New optional `optimize_prompt` toggle in 🧬 Encoding Enchantress compresses redundant tags and canonicalizes aliases to reduce total token count — improving effective attention on what matters.
- Purely algorithmic (no LLM). Uses curated allowlists, alias maps, and feature metadata bundled under `node_resources/`.
- Safe heuristics: preserves unknowns, applies conservative fuzzy matching with a retention guard, and adds back originals if a reduction would over-trim.
- Scope: optimizes positive segments only (quality, scene, glamour, body, aesthetic, pose). Negatives are left unchanged. Disabled automatically when 🔮 Oracle's Override is used.
- Reporting: when `token_report` is enabled, a "🪙 Token Savings" section is appended showing per-segment and total before→after token counts.

### �🧹 Cleanup (Legacy Removal)

- Fully removed legacy character nodes from the repository: `Character Creator` and `Character Cache`.
- Backend character module is wireless-only now: removed prompt-time UI sync code; kept REST endpoints for Curator (GET/POST/DELETE `/violet/character`).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-26

### ✨ Wireless Character Flow

- Merged Character Creator + Character Cache into a single, wireless-only 💖 Character Curator node.
- Removed all character wiring and apply toggles from prompt nodes; Curator handles save/load via UI only.
- Frontend buttons on Curator: Load Character to All, Save Character, Delete Character.
- Backend endpoints: GET/POST/DELETE /violet/character. GET now supports list mode via `?list=1` and also returns a name list when no `name` is provided.

### 💄 UX — Autocomplete/Browse Names

- Added a Browse Names overlay for the Curator’s `save_character` field:
  - Click “Browse Names” to open a searchable overlay of saved character names.
  - Type to filter and click to select a name to prefill for safe overwrite.
  - Fully wireless — no canvas wiring required.

### 🧰 Internals

- Web: `vt-node-styling.js` injects Curator buttons and overlay UI.
- Server: `node_resources/character_sync.py` adds name listing (`_list_character_names`) and bumps saved payload `violet_tools_version` to `2.0.0`.
- Kept all existing string type identifiers and return orders stable for compatibility.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-09-26

### ✨ Improvements (1.5.0)

- Unified output bundling from all prompt nodes: each node now emits a single value that includes both the rendered text and its structured selections (dropdown choices, fem/masc toggles, strengths, extra). This keeps the UI clean—no extra ports—while enabling robust character persistence.
- Encoding Enchantress now transparently unwraps bundled inputs and merges structured fields into the character JSON next to the existing "text" entry for each domain.
- Added wildcard parsing to every node’s "extra" field with label hint "extra, wildcards". Supports {a|b|c} syntax and resolves once per run.

### 🐛 Fixes (1.5.0)

- Resolved warning in Aesthetic Alchemist when inputs were set to None by updating `IS_CHANGED(**_kwargs)` to accept keyword args.

### 🔧 Internal (1.5.0)

- Kept all public names, return orders, and categories stable to avoid breaking saved workflows. The bundling is an additive internal contract; plain strings still work for backward compatibility.

All notable changes to ComfyUI Violet Tools will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.1] - 2025-09-15

### 💄 Style

- **Color Chips Lean Refactor**: Trimmed `vt-colorchips.js` by removing deprecated emoji rendering, legacy popup chip grid, search + tooltip UI, unused sanitation pass, DOM inspection helpers, and redundant enhancement tracking.
- **Node Styling Scope Refined**: Reverted experimental widget row + multiline background skinning. Retained only core node branding (background color + Encoding Enchantress logo). Prevents draw stack interference and keeps ComfyUI widget visuals standard.

### 🔧 Internal (Chips)

- Simplified config surface (only `enabled`, `popupEnhancement`, `debugLogging`).
- Maintained inline dropdown color chip decoration and canvas foreground chip rendering (no workflow impact).
- Reduced script size (−430+ LOC) for faster parse and lower maintenance overhead.

### ✨ Improvements

- **Color Chips Refinement**: Consolidated to a single production `vt-colorchips.js` file; removed legacy `-debug` and `-simple` variants.
- **Visual Alignment**: Added precise offset layout for inline color chips in node widgets; improved dropdown chip prefixes.
- **Logo Positioning**: Encoding Enchantress logo top-aligned and sizing stabilized.
- **Output Reorder**: `Encoding Enchantress` outputs now ordered as `positive, negative, tokens, character, pos, neg` with `pos_text/neg_text` renamed externally to `pos/neg`.
- **Skin Tone Palette Update**: Adjusted olive, golden, amber, mahogany, cocoa, ebony, dark ebony hex values; removed obsolete `light ebony` shade.

### 🧹 Cleanup

- Removed verbose console debugging from color chip extension.
- Deleted unused `vt-colorchips-debug.js` and `vt-colorchips-simple.js`.

### 🔧 Internal

- Minor refactors for maintainability; no breaking API changes.

## [1.3.5] - 2025-09-14

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Critical Path Issue**: Fixed YAML file path resolution for nodes moved to `nodes/` directory
  - Corrected `feature_lists` path resolution in all node files
  - Added proper parent directory navigation (`os.path.dirname` called twice)
  - Resolves `FileNotFoundError` on ComfyUI startup that prevented extension loading
  - Affects all nodes: Quality Queen, Glamour Goddess, Body Bard, Aesthetic Alchemist, Pose Priestess, Scene Seductress, Negativity Nullifier, Encoding Enchantress

### 📋 Notes

## [1.3.2] - 2025-09-14

### 🏗️ Organizational

- **Node Structure**: Moved all nodes to `nodes/` directory for better organization
- **Category Organization**: Split nodes into logical UI categories:
  - `Violet Tools 💅/Prompt`: Quality Queen, Scene Seductress, Glamour Goddess, Body Bard, Aesthetic Alchemist, Pose Priestess, Negativity Nullifier
  - `Violet Tools 💅/Character`: Character Creator, Character Cache, Encoding Enchantress
- **File Naming**: Renamed persona files to match class names:
  - `persona_preserver.py` → `character_creator.py`
  - `persona_patcher.py` → `character_cache.py`

### 🎯 Improved (Persona System)

- **Node Names**: Refined naming for better semantic clarity:
  - "Persona Preserver" → "💖 Character Creator"
  - "Persona Patcher" → "🗃️ Character Cache"
- **Auto-Refresh**: Character Cache now automatically refreshes without manual toggle
- **Parameter Consistency**: Standardized all nodes to use `character` parameter name

### 📝 Documentation

- Updated README.md with new file structure and terminology
- Revised Quick Start guide to reflect Character Creator/Cache workflow
- Updated file structure documentation

## [1.3.1] - 2025-09-14

### 🎯 Improved

- **Persona System UX**: Streamlined persona workflow with single character input/output
- **Character Profiles**: Removed truncation limits for full character data visibility
- **Simplified Workflow**: Persona Preserver now connects directly to Encoding Enchantress character output
- **Better Naming**: Renamed inputs/outputs for clarity (character_data → character, character_name → name)

### 🔧 Fixed (Persona System)

- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Added proper encoding declarations for Windows compatibility
- **Directory Paths**: Characters now save to ComfyUI's output directory for easy access
- **Node Registration**: Resolved encoding issues preventing persona nodes from loading

### 📝 Technical

- Updated version references across all components
- Improved error handling and status messages
- Enhanced character profile display in Persona Patcher

## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-14

### Added

- **Persona Patcher Enhancements**: Dynamic dropdown of saved characters with `random` selection and manual `refresh` toggle.
- **Silent Schema Migration**: Older character JSONs auto-normalize to current schema (1.3.x) and are transparently rewritten.
- **Character Data Passthrough**: `Encoding Enchantress` can generate prompts directly from `CHARACTER_DATA` when intermediate nodes are omitted.

### Changed

- **Persona Preserver**: Refactored to save-only node (loading fully delegated to Persona Patcher) and version bumped to `violet_tools_version: 1.3.0`.
- **Uniform Overrides**: All Violet Tools nodes now support `character_data` + `character_apply` pattern for persona-driven population without overwriting explicit user inputs.

### Technical

- Automatic file rewrite after migration ensures consistent on-disk structure (adds missing sections, renames `nullifier` → `negative`).
- Stable schema shape maintained: `data.{quality, scene, glamour, body, aesthetic, pose, negative}`.

### Notes

- Migration is silent by design (no warnings, no failures) to keep workflows uninterrupted.
- Future minor versions can introduce schema_version stamping if needed; current approach leverages `violet_tools_version`.

### Upgrade Guidance

- Update the extension directory; first load of each existing persona will normalize it automatically.
- No manual intervention required.
